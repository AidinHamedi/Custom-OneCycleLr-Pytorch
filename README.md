# OneCycle Learning Rate Scheduler (Custom Implementation)

A custom implementation of the OneCycle learning rate scheduler for PyTorch.

## Features
- Customized version of the OneCycleLR algorithm with four distinct phases: warmup, idling, annealing, and decay.
- Flexibility in defining various hyperparameters such as:
  - Warmup iterations and type (linear or exponential)
  - Idling period duration
  - Annealing phase duration and minimum learning rate
  - Decay phase duration and minimum learning rate
- Compatibility with any PyTorch optimizer

## Installation

### Using Poetry
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AidinHamedi/Custom-OneCycleLr-Pytorch.git
cd Custom-OneCycleLr-Pytorch
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install --extras dev,doc
```

### Manual Installation (Optional)
If you prefer not to use Poetry, you can manually install the package using pip after cloning the repository.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to integrate the scheduler into your training loop:

```python
import torch
from custom_onecyclelr import scheduler

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = YourModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Create the OneCycleLR scheduler with desired parameters
scheduler_instance = scheduler.OneCycleLr(
    optimizer,
    warmup_iters=6,  # Number of iterations for the warmup phase
    lr_ idling_ iters=8,  # Number of iterations where learning rate remains at max
    annealing_ iters=56,  # Cosine annealing phase duration
    decay_ iters=100,  # Linear decay phase duration
    max_lr=0.01,
    annealing_lr_min=0.001,
    decay_lr_min=0.0001,
    warmup_start_ lr=0.0001,
    warmup_type="exp"  # "linear" or "exp"
)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(total_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        scheduler_instance.step()

```

## Visualization

You can visualize how the learning rate changes over iterations by running:

```bash
python examples/vis.py
```

This will generate a plot showing the different phases of the learning rate schedule.
